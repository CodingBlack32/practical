    <h1><strong>A List of My Current Reads</strong></h1>
    <p>I am an advent reader. One of my greatest dreams is to own a library/book store. <br>I believe that people do not read anymore, and when they do it is all digitized. <br>I absolutely love the feeling and aesthetic that comes with physical paperback or hardcover. <br> Below is a list of some of my favorites.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Children of Blood and Bone(Vol 1 & 2)</li>
      <li>Witches Steeped in Gold</li>
      <li>12 Laws of the Universe</li>
      <li>Soft Magic</li>
      <li>Nectar</li>
      <li>A Fire Like You</li>
      <li>Blood Like Magic</li>
    </ol>
